# Swegram

## Introduction

Swegram is a tool that offers the ability to annotate and analyse Swedish and English texts. You can upload one or more texts and have them linguistically analysed with morphological and syntactic features. These linguistically annotated texts can then be used to perform quantitative linguistic text analysis; for example, the tool provides statistics about sentence lengths, total number of words, various readability metrics, part-of-speech (PoS) distribution, as well as frequency of lemmas, PoS, or misspelled words. The tool also visualize the syntactic relations between words in sentences and give detailed information about the distribution of various syntactic functions and relations in the text.
