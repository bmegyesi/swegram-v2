These notes are written with linux/macos in mind since that's what I'm using. There are a few things that'd be
different for Windows, such as piping pip freeze to a file but it shouldn't be too much trouble to figure out.<br>
I will refer to <i>production</i> and <i>local</i> which refers to the code running on the stp server and the code
running on a local machine respectively.<br>

<h3>1. Python, virtualenv and pip</h3>
Swegram is written for python 2.<br>
It's generally a good idea to use <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtual environments</a> when working
with python projects. This makes sure that all the libraries you need can be installed for that project specifically,
using the correct versions. It's also a good idea to have <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> installed,
which makes it easy to install libraries for python. <br>
Assuming you have virtualenv and pip installed, run the following to set up a new virtual environment called <i>swegram</i><br>
<span class="sourcecode">virtualenv swegram</span><br>
which sets up the virtual environment in the current folder. In order to activate it, simply run
<span class="sourcecode">source swegram/bin/activate</span><br><br>
To run swegram, a few libraries need to be installed. These can be found in <span class="sourcecode">requirements.txt</span> which
is located in the root folder of the project. Using pip, these can be installed with<br>
<span class="sourcecode">pip install -r requirements.txt</span><br>
If you decide to include any new packages, it's a good idea to also update <span class="sourcecode">requirements.txt</span>. This
can be done by running<br>
<span class="sourcecode">pip freeze > requirements.txt</span><br>

<h3>2. Configuration</h3>
The configuration is split between three files: <span class="sourcecode">base.py</span>,  <span class="sourcecode">production.py</span>
and <span class="sourcecode">local.py</span>.<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="sourcecode">base.py</span> contains the part of the configuration that are always the same on production and
    local, such as installed apps, timezone and template locations. If you look at the last lines of this file, you can see
    that it import either <span class="sourcecode">production.py</span> or <span class="sourcecode">local.py</span> depending
    on whether the machine is running Linux or not. <b>Note that you will have to change this if you're running Linux on your
    own machine to avoid the production config to be loaded</b>. Even if you're not running Linux on your own machine,
    imorting the configs using this method is bad practice so feel free to come up with a better solution if you have the time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="sourcecode">production.py</span> contains the rest of the config when running in production, such as how to access
    postgresql for the swegram user on the stp server. I have noted that this file as found on git might differ from the
    one actually in production (i.e. I have probably made some changes directly to the file without using git), <b>please
    be aware of this if you're pushing changes to production</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="sourcecode">local.py</span> contains the rest of the config when running locally. The main difference between
    this config and the production config is the database and cache backends.
  </li>
</ul>
Note that the DEBUG variable always should be set to False on production. I have sometimes set it to True when debugging
in production, but remember to change it back to False when you're done if you decide to do that.


<h3>3. Database and cache</h3>
<h4>3.1 Production</h4>
In production, swegram uses postgresql as a database. The only things stored in the database are the user accounts (which is only
the admin account and isn't really used for anything except for maybe debugging using the /admin page) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">md5</a> hashes of uploaded files.
The reason for storing md5 hashes of the uploaded files is that if a user <br>
1) uploads and annotates a new file with normalization<br>
2) downloads the file<br>
3) re-uploads the file as an already annotated file<br>
we want to know whether that file was normalized so that we can produce statistics correctly. Using md5 hashes and storing them
in the database allows us to save that information. In <i>models.py</i> you can find the model that handles this.<br><br>
In addition to the database, caching is used for the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/sessions/">
sessions</a>. For production, this is also handled by posgresql. Normally a caching server such as memcached or Redis would
be used for this, but given the relatively low traffic on swegram, postgres works just fine.
<h4>3.2 Local</h4>
For local development, I have used posgres as well. I would however recommend using
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#databases">SQLite</a> instead. SQLite is very easy to set up
(you don't need any additional software running, Django handles everything for you) and saves all the data in a single file
in the root directory of the project, making it easy to share the database if needed. There is also no difference in
performance between postgresql and SQLite when running locally (SQLite would probably even work just as well as
postgresql in production).<br>
For caching locally, it doesn't matter much which method you use. If you choose DatabaseCache, the default database
will be used for caching, which is what I typically do. Another method that can be used is LocMemCache. This stores
the cache directly in memory, which is really fast (but again, the difference is so small that you won't notice a
difference). <br>There is one notable difference between LocMemCache and DatabaseCache though: when using LocMemCache, the cache
is wiped every time you make a change in the code (which triggers the server to reload it), while if you use DatabaseCache,
the data persists even if you make changes to the code. I have found LocMemCache to be usedful when I for instance debug
something related to uploading files, so that I don't have a huge pile of uploaded files after I've uploaded 10+ times. <br>
If you want to learn more about caching in Django, check out <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/cache/">
this</a>. And if you want to learn more about caching in general, <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> might be fun to
fiddle with. It's easy to get it running with Django and it's used by lots of big sites like instagram and stackoverflow. <br>

<h3>4. Prerequisites</h3>
There are two packages -- <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe">UDPipe</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robertostling/efselab">
efselab</a> -- that are required by swegram but not included in the git repository. These need to be obtained separately from their
respective repositories. <br>
UDPipe is used for the English annotation pipeline, and should be stored in <span class="sourcecode">
swegram_main/handle_texts/pipeline/nlp/udpipe/udpipe</span><br>
efselab is used for the Swegish annotation pipeline, and should be stored in <span class="sourcecode">
swegram_main/handle_texts/pipeline/nlp/efselab</span>.<br> Note that it's not the default efselab we're using, but the swedish annotation
pipeline. Instructions for installing this are
available in the <a href="https://github.com/robertostling/efselab#swedish-annotation-pipeline">repository readme</a>.

<h3>5. Data structure</h3>
The uploaded data is represented as various objects in swegram. Each uploaded text file is represented as a <span class="sourcecode">
Textfile</span> object,
which in turn contains a list of <span class="sourcecode">Text</span> objects (each individual text found in the file). The texts
objects have a number of variables such as metadata and word count, as well as a list of <span class="sourcecode">Sentence</span> objects.
Each <span class="sourcecode">Sentence</span> object consists only of a lit of <span class="sourcecode">Token</span> objects, which
basically contain the raw data for each token, i.e. form, norm, lemma, upos etc. Check <i>handle_texts/import_text.py</i> for more
information.

<h3>6. Code structure</h3>
In <span class="sourcecode">swegram_main/templates/swegram_main(_english)</span> you'll find all the html. To build the templates,
I'm using <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars</a>, and the templates build with handlebars can be found in <span class="sourcecode">
handlebars_templates.html</span>.<br>
All the javascript and css is located in <span class="sourcecode">swegram_main/static/swegram_main</span>. If any of these files are changed
and applied to production, you have to run<br>
<span class="sourcecode">python manage.py collectstatic</span><br>
on the server.
This moves the static files to the static folder which is served by the web server on the URL <span class="sourcecode">
https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/swegramstatic/swegram_main/</span>.<br>
Some other important files are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>urls.py</i> - URL dispatcher, it should be fairly straightforward, check the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/urls/">
      official documentation</a> for more info.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>views.py</i> - contains the views of swegram. This mainly determines that languages and returns the correct templates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>handle_texts/helpers.py</i> - contains various helper methods as well as methods for downloading data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>handle_texts/import_texts.py</i> - contains the class definitions for the texts as described in <i>5. Data structure</i>. This also
    contains the methods that create the Textfile objects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>handle_texts/statistics.py</i> - statistics calculations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>handle_texts/upload_file.py</i> - handles file uploads, both raw texts that are to be annotated, and already annotated texts for which
    statistics are just calculated.
  </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
To exemplify how the statistics are calculated, let's pretend we want to implement a new statistic that counts how many words contains the character
<i>a</i> in total:<br>
First we need to be able to reach the method. If you look at the url dispatcher, various types of statistics have their own url so that data
can be fetched. So for this example, we'll create a new url called <i>/character_a/</i> which points to a function in <i>statistics.py</i>
called <i>character_a</i>. <br>
This function takes one argument: <i>request</i>, which contains our session (which contains lots of things such as a list of the texts that
we have loaded and various statistics) among other things, thus our function will be defined as<br><br>
<span class="sourcecode">def character_a(request):</span><br>
<span class="sourcecode">&nbsp occurrences = 0 # contains the number of occurrences</span><br><br>
<span class="sourcecode">&nbsp for text in request.session.get('text_list'):</span><br>
<span class="sourcecode">&nbsp &nbsp for sentence in text.sentences:</span><br>
<span class="sourcecode">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp for token in sentence.tokens:</span><br>
<span class="sourcecode">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp if 'a' in token.norm.lower():</span><br>
<span class="sourcecode">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp occurrences += 1</span><br><br>
<span class="sourcecode">&nbsp return JsonResponse('a_occurrences': occurrences)</span><br><br>

We can now access this statistic by going to <i>/character_a/</i>, and we'll get a Json object in return. <br>
The data is typically accessed using ajax; have a look at stats.js, for example like 161, where readability is loaded. If you look at line 168,
you can see that the data is rendered to the <i>readability_zone</i> template, which is defined in <i>handlebars_templates.html</i> on line 123.<br>
<i>readability_zone</i> is in turn included in <i>readability_section.html</i>.<br><br>
Whenever you make changes in the code in production, run the following while in the &ltproject-root&gt/swegram to apply the changes:<br>
<span class="sourcecode">touch wsgi.py</span>
</body>

<h3>7. Running</h3>
You don't need a real web server to run Django, simply type<br>
<span class="sourcecode">python manage.py runserver</span><br>
to run a web server at 127.0.0.1:8000.<br>
You can also specify ip and port by running for instance<br>
<span class="sourcecode">python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.2:80</span><br>

<h3>8. Misc</h3>
<h4>8.1 numpy</h4>
I have had some problems running numpy with django, causing spontaneous deadlocks. Since I only used numpy for simple functions such as
mean and median I just made my own functions for that instead of trying to fix the actual issue. There is some information on it
<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/modwsgi/wikis/ApplicationIssues.wiki#Python_Simplified_GIL_State_API">here</a> if you're
interested. This also applies to other C-based libraries such as scipy.
<h4>8.2 Troubleshooting</h4>
If errors occur in production, in addition to setting DEBUG to True, also check the server log which is located in <i>/var/log/httpd/error_log</i>.
Since it's usually very long, use tail to only get the last <i>n</i> lines, such as<br>
 <span class="sourcecode">tail -n 200 /var/log/httpd/error_log</span><br><br>
 It's possible to get emails whenever errors occur by setting the ADMINS variable in the settings, see <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#admins">
   here</a>.
